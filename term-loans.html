                    <h3>Why do businesses get term loans?</h3>
                    <p>Business term loans are a common financing option that small businesses use to fund large expenses while keeping cash flow stable. One of their advantages is a fixed repayment schedule. With fixed daily, weekly or monthly payments businesses can easily forecast expenses and manage debt.</p>
                    <p>Businesses often use term loans to cover the cost of essential needs such as purchasing equipment, expanding operations or covering cash flow gaps. For example, in the construction industry, term loans can help fund the purchase of new machinery or bridge cash flow gaps during slower building seasons. Landscaping businesses often use term loans to invest in tools and supplies in preparation for the busy season. In healthcare, term loans can support the purchase of advanced medical equipment or help manage operational costs.</p>
                    <p>The flexibility of a small business term loan allows it to address industry-specific needs and helps businesses plan for growth and stability.</p>

                    <h3>What are some examples of how term loans can be used?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Expansion.</strong> Small business term loans can be used to fund the renovation of your current space or the opening of a new location. This can help you grow your business without putting too much strain on your operating budget.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cash flow.</strong> Things like seasonal shifts and unexpected business expenses can cause cash flow issues. A cash flow loan can help you navigate gaps and take care of your business needs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Equipment.</strong> Equipment loans can help you purchase expensive hardware for your business, whether its heavy machinery for construction or upgraded tech for your office.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inventory.</strong> Inventory loans can provide you with the capital to purchase inventory in bulk. This can help you maximize your savings when you take advantage of the bulk discounts some vendors offer.</p>

                    <h3>What is the rate of interest for a term loan?</h3>
                    <p>The interest rates on term loans can vary depending on several factors. Different lenders will have different eligibility requirements, but in general they will try to assess the overall financial health and creditworthiness of your business before setting the loan terms.</p>
                    <p>Lenders will often look at things like your business or personal credit score, the amount you want to borrow, the length of the term and the overall health of your business finances to determine the interest rate on your term loan. Comparing offers from different lenders could help you find the most competitive rates.</p>

                <div class="requirement-item">
                    <h3>Is a business term loan the same as a working capital loan?</h3>
                    <p>Working capital loans are essentially a type of business term loan, the key difference comes down to how they're used. Working capital loans are short-term loans used to cover daily operations or fix temporary cash flow gaps. They are typically unsecured loans and terms can be as short as a few months.</p>
                    <p>Business term loans are often for a larger sum of money and have longer terms. Business terms loans are often used to fund long-term investments like expanding your business or purchasing expensive equipment.</p>

                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>What other types of business loan options are available?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Business line of credit.</strong> A business line of credit is a form of revolving credit. If approved, you'll gain access to a credit limit you can draw from. As you repay, the funds become available to borrow again. Business term loans can help you manage cash flow and are good for ongoing expenses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Business credit card.</strong> Business credit cards are another type of revolving credit. You'll charge purchases to the card's credit limit and as you pay the balance down, the credit limit becomes available for use again. They can help you manage smaller, day-to-day expenses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Equipment financing.</strong> Equipment financing is a type of secured term loan used to purchase expensive equipment for your business. They work similarly to a term loan in that they provide a lump sum that you repay over time. However, since these loans are typically secured — the equipment often acts as the collateral.</p>
                    <p><strong>Merchant cash advance.</strong> Merchant cash advances are not technically loans. Instead of borrowing money, you'll sell a portion of your future revenues. The provider is essentially paying an upfront lump sum of cash for a portion of your future credit card sales.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>Can I repay my Care Capital Group Term Loan early?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. If you qualify for our 100% prepayment benefit option, you can pay your loan off early in full and have all remaining interest waived without any penalty or fee.‡ If you don't qualify for the 100% prepayment benefit option, you'll be responsible for repaying 75% of the remaining unpaid interest if you repay early.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>Are payments fixed or variable?</h3>
                    <p>Payments for Care Capital Group's term loan are fixed, so you'll pay the same amount from the beginning to the end of your repayment term. This allows you to manage your cash flow with no surprises or large costs upfront.</p>

                    <p>* Instant Funding requires registration and is subject to the Instant Funding Terms & Conditions. Instant Funding is limited to open lines of credit for draws between $1,000 - $10,000, and you can only make one draw request per day. Not all banks or debit card providers participate, and you must register a business debit card matching the information associated with your Care Capital Group account. Transfers are typically completed within 30 minutes, but may be subject to additional restrictions or delays.</p>
                    <p>** There are some industries we cannot serve (see list of restricted industries). In addition, Care Capital Group does not lend to businesses in North Dakota. Other underwriting requirements may apply.</p>
                    <p>† When you pay off an Cares Capital Group term loan early, you may still need to pay a portion of the unpaid interest expense as stated in the loan agreement. The specific percentage will be disclosed in your loan agreement.</p>
                    <p>‡ Eligibility for the lowest rates is very limited, available only to businesses with the strongest creditworthiness and cash flows, and typically businesses that have shown an excellent payment history on prior loan products with Care Capital Group.
